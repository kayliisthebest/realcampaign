	<h1>The National Safety Council reports that using your cell phone while driving results in 1.6 million crashes each year. You or someone you know could be part of these crashes. This is why it is important to spread awareness to prevent people from using their phone while driving. The most common case of cell phone use while driving is because the driver is texting. About 390,000 injuries occur yearly from accidents caused by texting while driving. So many lives could be saved just by saving a text until later.</h1>
