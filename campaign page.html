  <center><h1>Now it is time for you to go out there and make a change. Tell everyone you know that drives that sending a text or two while risking your life is NOT worth it. If necessary then just have whoever is in your passenger seat do it for you. Get some sort of bluetooth device. There are so many options. Do not risk your life and the lives of those around you because of something you could easily prevent. Please spread the word. Texting while driving is banned in 47 states so help ban it in the rests. Sign some petitions. Speak up about it on social media. Tell anyone and everyone.</h1></center>
