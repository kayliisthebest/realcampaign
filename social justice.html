  <center><h1>A study done by the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute in 2009 has proven that crashes are 23 times as likely to occur when someone texts while driving. Not only are you putting your own life at risk, but everyone on the road with you. Imagine how many families you are hurting just because you need to get out a sentence you could easily save for later. The study has said these exact words, if you are driving at 55 mph and take your eyes off the road for the average amount of time it takes to text, five seconds, you will have zoomed the length of a football field without looking at the road. Sure this study was done ten years before now, but texting while driving is still a common issue. </center></h1>

  <center><h1>As of March, 2019 texting while driving is banned in 47 states which is a huge improvement but it is not like the police can peep in every car of every second to see whether they are texting or not. That is why we must do our part as society and spread the word. Stop texting while driving. You are not only putting your life at risk, but the lives of others as well.</h1></center>
